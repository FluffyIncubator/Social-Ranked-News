# Social-Ranked-News

The goal of this project is to define a standard for ranking news stories based on the issue that address, how many people are affected by the issue, and how long the issue has gone without resolution. By a standard like this, a story that has impacted a very large number of people for a long time would be ranked higher and appear towards the "top" of the news feed.
